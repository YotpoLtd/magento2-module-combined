# Canonical full validation for this repository. Scaffold from

# Contract -- do not change it, the pipeline depends on it:
#   - run from the repository root, no arguments
#   - echo each command before running it
#   - exit 0  every check passed
#   - exit 1  a check failed
#   - exit 2  not configured / cannot validate -- NOT a pass
#   - never commit, never push, never mutate git state
#
# Exit 2 exists so "cannot validate" is never read as "failed" (hides a broken
# environment) or as "passed" (an unconfigured repo would earn ready-for-merge).

#   metapackage (composer.json) with no code, tests or linter.
